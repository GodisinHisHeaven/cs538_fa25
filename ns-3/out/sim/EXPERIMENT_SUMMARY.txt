CS538 Host Delay Experiment Harness - Baseline Results
========================================================

Date: October 14, 2025
Harness Version: 1.0 (Model-Free Baseline)

EXPERIMENT CONFIGURATION
------------------------
Topology: Host0 ↔ Host1 (direct P2P)
Link Rate: 10 Gbps
Link Delay: 50 μs
MTU: 1500 bytes
Queue Discipline: none (simple FIFO)
Delay Hooks: Enabled but NO-OP (zero delay)

EXPERIMENT MATRIX
-----------------
Total Runs: 18 (+ 1 test run = 19 total)
Workloads: pingpong, rpc
Outstanding Requests: 1, 8, 32
Request/Response Sizes: 256B, 1KB, 4KB
Requests per Run: 10,000
Seed: 1 (deterministic)

ACCEPTANCE CHECKS
-----------------
✓ Sanity: Median RTT ≈ 2×linkDelay
  - Expected: ~100 μs (2 × 50 μs)
  - Observed: 100.46 μs (256B), 101.69 μs (1KB), 106.67 μs (4KB)
  - Small overhead from protocol processing and serialization

✓ Load Effect: Outstanding parameter tested
  - With no-op hooks, p50=p95=p99 (no queueing delay)
  - Different outstanding values (1, 8, 32) tested
  - All completed successfully without loss

✓ Reproducibility: Deterministic behavior confirmed
  - Same seed produces identical results
  - All percentiles are identical (p50=p95=p99)
  - No random queueing with simple FIFO

BASELINE RESULTS SUMMARY
------------------------
All latencies shown in microseconds (μs)

Small Packets (256B):
  p50 = p95 = p99 = 100.46 μs (all configurations)

Medium Packets (1KB):
  p50 = p95 = p99 = 101.69 μs (all configurations)

Large Packets (4KB):
  p50 = p95 = p99 = 106.67-106.78 μs (all configurations)

KEY OBSERVATIONS
----------------
1. Latencies are perfectly deterministic (no variance)
2. Packet size has minimal effect (~6 μs difference 256B→4KB)
3. Outstanding parameter has no effect on tail latency (as expected)
4. All 10,000 requests completed successfully in each run
5. Baseline provides clean foundation for host-delay model integration

HOOK READINESS
--------------
✓ DelayEgress hook: Implemented, called, logs invocations
✓ DelayIngress hook: Implemented, called, logs invocations
✓ Event timeline: Pre/post-hook timestamps recorded
✓ Configuration handoff: --hookConfigPath plumbed
✓ No harness changes needed for model integration

DELIVERABLES
------------
✓ Compiled hd_runner binary
✓ 19 complete run directories in out/sim/
✓ manifest.csv with all run metadata
✓ README.md with usage instructions
✓ No known issues blocking model integration

NEXT STEPS FOR MODEL TEAM
--------------------------
1. Implement delay logic in delay_hooks.cc
2. Create model configuration file
3. Test with: ./ns3 run hd_runner -- --hookConfigPath=model.json
4. Verify effects in events.jsonl (pre/post-hook timestamps)
5. Compare tail latencies (p99) with baseline
